**Android-MCP** is a lightweight, open-source bridge between AI agents and Android devices. Running as an MCP server, it lets large-language-model agents perform real-world tasks such as **app navigation, UI interaction and automated QA testing** without relying on traditional computer-vision pipelines.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Native Android Integration**  
  Interact with UI elements via ADB and the Android Accessibility API: launch apps, tap, swipe, input text, and read view hierarchies.

- **Bring Your Own LLM (Vision Optional)**  
  Works with any language model‚Äîno fine-tuned CV model or OCR pipeline required.

- **Rich Toolset for Mobile Automation**  
  Pre-built tools for gestures, keystrokes, capture, device state.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., two taps) ranges **2 ‚Äì 5 s** depending on device specs and load.

### Supported Operating Systems

- Android 10+

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Android Studio**

### üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CursorTouch/Android-MCP.git
   cd Android-MCP
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```shell
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

3. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Add the following JSON (replace `{{PATH}}` placeholders) to your client config:

```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "android-mcp": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/Android-MCP",
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
```

For Claude Desktop, save as `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

4. **Enable ADB & authorize your device**

```shell
   adb devices   # verify that your phone/tablet appears and is "authorized"
```

5. **Restart the Claude Desktop**

   Open your Claude Desktop, ‚ÄúAndroid-MCP‚Äù should now appear as an integration.

For troubleshooting tips (log locations, common ADB issues), see the [MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#android-mcp-integration-issues).
